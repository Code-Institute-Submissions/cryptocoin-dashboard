# Cryptocurrencies Dashboard

Welcome, 

The development of this web application was carried out as my Third Milestone Project for the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma from the Code Institute.  

This appliction's code was written on my own using Python, the Flask Framework, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to demonstrate my personal skills and acquired knowledge from this online program. Some other libraries which are listed later on were used as well to simplify functions and styling. 

The application is deployed and available in Heroku and can be accessed here:

Feel free to use it and reach out for any comments or suggestions that you may have. 

## UX

![Responsive Image](documentation/images/myCryptocoinDashboardResponsive.png)

The main objective was to create a simulation application that allow users to learn and practice trading and monitoring cryptocurrency assets. The application was conceived as a pure simulation and thus does not handle any real currencies. All the data displayed concerning traditional or digital currencies are solely for learning purposes and do not posses any real value.
 
This importance for this web application was identified through some User Stories like the following:
 
- "I always wondered how it is to trade and hold Cryptocurrencies. I have read in the news that they are mostly earning value but I do not understand the concept of how to buy them. It would be good to find an application which allows me first to do some practice before I can go into the real thing."
- "I have heared of Bitcoin, but I do not know really if there are other Cryptocurrencies out there. It would be interesting to know which are the most popular ones and monitor if their prices are incresing."
- "Some Cryptocurrencies are very expensive. I could not afford to buy a single one. Though I would be interested to know if I can buy only part of one cryptocoin and start small and do only trading until I can earn some cash to buy more coins. But without real money I do not find an application that lets me do any trading."
- "I like trading applications that are easy to use and very visual. Specially I like being able to check my performance over time with charts and plots."

The user experience design of this application was first conceived using wireframes on miro.com. The file is available for visualization under this link: 
[Miro Wireframe - Cryptocoin Dashboard Wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ksDZXO4=/)
As observed on the wireframe, the "dashboard" page was designed as the main page of this application and its responsiveness for different screen sizes was considered. 

![Wireframe Image](documentation/images/MyCryptoDashboard_Overview.jpg)

All sections of the "dashboard" page from the wireframes were developed with some minor changes:
 - The performance history line chart was moved to a separate html page to reduce API calls because they are limited by my personal account on the Alpha Vantage API service.
 - Transaction lists occupies whole width of screen now because they contain more information than other cards from dashboard.

## Technologies Used

Languages, frameworks, libraries used to construct this project:

- Python
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [IEX Cloud Financial Data API](https://iexcloud.io/)
    - Real-Time & historical financial data for this web application. The IEX Cloud sandbox was mostly used to test out and integrate the API into the application. 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
    - Data storage and database management
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery code was used to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.
- [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)
    - The project uses **Materialize** to simplify giving styles and adding JavaScripts to different elements. Also it is found in the navbar construct, its grid-layout system was used, as well as other elements like modals, tables, badges, etc to complement the application. 
- [Plotly Graphic Libraries](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/)
    - Plotly Open Source Graphing Libraries: interactive charts and maps for Python and JavaScript.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Online IDE for GitHub to develop code of this project. 
- [Font Awesome Icon Library](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
    - Icons were imported to provide some visual iconography, e.g. star icon for buttons to save stocks in Watch List.
- [Google Font Library](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Imported two different fonts, Abril Fatface and Questrial for texts. 
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is)
    - Testing responsiveness of the applicaton in different devices, like the example below:
- [Cryptocurrency Icons](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons)
    - Creating cryptocurrency icons for coins used in this project. Library includes SVG files for around 400 crypto currencies to create 32x32 PNG files respectively.

## Deployment

The code was developed solely on GitPod and then it was pushed to an external repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/bramrodrigo89).
The settings of this GitHub repository were changed to host the code into GitHub Pages from the **master branch.**
Currently the GitHub site is published here: 

To deploy the project from its repository, the following should be taken:

1. Log in to GitHub.com
2. From the repository screen, select this project "/second-milestone-project"
3. On top of the page, click on the last right icon "Settings".
4. Scroll down until you reach the GitHub Pages section.
5. Change the source to the "Master Branch" using the drop down menu, labelled by default first as "none".
6. The application is now deployed on GitHub pages!
7. Copy the provided link from this section and share with others.
