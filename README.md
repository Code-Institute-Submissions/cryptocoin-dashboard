## Deployment

The code was developed solely on GitPod and then it was pushed to an external repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/bramrodrigo89).
The settings of this GitHub repository were changed to host the code into GitHub Pages from the **master branch.**
Currently the GitHub site is published here: 

To deploy the project from its repository, the following should be taken:

1. Log in to GitHub.com
2. From the repository screen, select this project "/second-milestone-project"
3. On top of the page, click on the last right icon "Settings".
4. Scroll down until you reach the GitHub Pages section.
5. Change the source to the "Master Branch" using the drop down menu, labelled by default first as "none".
6. The application is now deployed on GitHub pages!
7. Copy the provided link from this section and share with others.
